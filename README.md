# Glassmorphism and Neumorphism Clocks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project showcases a web page with two clocks designed using Glassmorphism and Neumorphism styles. The Glassmorphism clock has a frosted glass-like appearance, while the Neumorphism clock features soft, extruded edges for a 3D effect. These modern design trends enhance the visual appeal and user experience.

## Features

- **Glassmorphism Clock**: A clock with a frosted glass-like design.
- **Neumorphism Clock**: A clock with soft, extruded edges for a 3D effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The clocks adjust smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Real-Time Display**: Both clocks show the current time in real-time.
